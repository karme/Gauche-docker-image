Perform self-host-test on development HEAD.

It pulls HEAD, compiles it on latest Gauche release, install it locally and
compiles it again with the HEAD version, then runs 'make -s check'.

Just invoke 'make run' to perform tests.

If you modify Dockerfile or other settings and want to test locally
(without making public images), say 'make run-ephemeral'.
