Perform self host test on development HEAD.

It pulls HEAD, compiles it on latest Gauche release, install it and
compiles itself again with the HEAD version, then runs 'make -s check'.

Then it pulls several Gauche extension modules, compiles them and
run tests for them.

Just invoke 'make run' to perform tests.

If you modify Dockerfile or other settings and want to test locally
(without making public images), say 'make run-ephemeral'.
